//! Phase 2 deploy — write the digest-verified target image, inject the per-host
//! config, and reboot into the provisioned OS (contract §9.1 step 5).
//!
//! This is the **destructive** half of provisioning. It runs in four live steps,
//! each gated by the one before:
//!   1. [`write_image`] (§9.1 5.1–5.2) — stream the whole-disk OS image
//!      (`beskar7.target`) straight onto the block device chosen by
//!      [`crate::target_disk`], verifying it against `beskar7.target-digest`.
//!   2. [`reread_partition_table`] (§9.1 5.3) — `BLKRRPART` so the freshly-written
//!      image's partitions appear; the caller then locates `COS_OEM`
//!      ([`crate::oem`]).
//!   3. [`inject_oem_config`] (§9.1 5.3) — mount the `COS_OEM` partition
//!      (`nodev,nosuid,noexec`), write the per-host Kairos cloud-config
//!      (`99_beskar7.yaml`, carrying the CAPI join secret) `0600`/root, `fsync`
//!      file + directory, and unmount.
//!   4. [`reboot_now`] (§9.1 5.4) — `reboot(2)` into the provisioned OS.
//!
//! ## Identity, never a re-resolvable path (TOCTOU guard, §5 / §9.1 5.3)
//! Neither destructive operation trusts a `/dev/<kname>` path it could re-resolve
//! to the wrong device:
//!   * The **whole-disk write** opens `/dev/<kname>` once (`O_EXCL`), then checks
//!     the *held fd's* `st_rdev` against [`TargetDisk::dev_number`] and that it is a
//!     block device — the check and the write share one fd, so nothing can repoint
//!     the device between them. `O_EXCL` also fails `EBUSY` on a mounted-but-not-
//!     system disk rather than clobbering it.
//!   * The **`COS_OEM` mount** does not mount a `/dev` path at all: it `mknod`s a
//!     private block node from the partition's enumerated `major:minor`
//!     ([`crate::oem::OemPartition::dev_number`]) and mounts that, so the mount is
//!     bound to the exact kernel device [`crate::oem`] enumerated on the target
//!     disk — immune to a `/dev` node being repointed between enumeration and mount.
//!
//! ## Bounded, RAM-free, digest-gated write (§8.1)
//! The image is streamed by [`crate::image::ImageFetcher::fetch_to`], hashing
//! incrementally (never buffering the multi-GB body) and returning `Ok` **only**
//! on a full-length digest match, bounded by `min(build max, disk capacity)`. On
//! any mismatch/short-read/size-breach the caller MUST NOT proceed to
//! mount/inject/reboot; the unbootable disk is recovered on the next attempt.
//!
//! ## Mount lifetime & failure cleanup (§9.1 5.4–5.5, finding H2)
//! [`inject_oem_config`] **always unmounts `COS_OEM` before returning**, on
//! success or failure (falling back to a lazy `MNT_DETACH` if the eager unmount is
//! busy) — so the partition is never left mounted across a reboot or a drop to a
//! debug shell. On an inject failure it first removes the partial `99_beskar7.yaml`
//! (which may hold the join secret) and *then* unmounts. (Unlinking the partial
//! frees but does not wipe its ext blocks on the target disk; that freed-block
//! remanence is accepted — the secret lives on this disk by design, and the disk
//! is unbootable until the next attempt overwrites the whole device.)
//!
//! ## Secret hygiene (§9)
//! The image and its digest are public. The **CAPI join secret** flows through
//! [`inject_oem_config`] as the `user_data` bytes: it is written **only** to the
//! `0600`/root `99_beskar7.yaml` on the verified `COS_OEM` partition, never
//! logged, and never placed in a [`DeployError`] (every variant carries only
//! device paths / `major:minor` / public digests, all non-secret). The caller
//! zeroes its `user_data` buffer after [`inject_oem_config`] returns.
