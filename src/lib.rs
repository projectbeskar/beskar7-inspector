//! beskar7-inspector library crate.
//!
//! Houses the contract-facing types and the modules the PID 1 init composes:
//! cmdline parsing, hardware probing, the verified-TLS callback client, target
//! image fetch + whole-disk deploy, `COS_OEM` location, and target-disk
//! selection. The binary (`src/main.rs`) is a thin PID 1 orchestrator over
//! [`run`], so every module is unit- and contract-testable without booting a
//! ramdisk.
